==== Generating the font textures =====

GENERAL:
In order to create a Font texture, you can use PVRTexTool to create the "glyphs" of the font and pack together all data that the
UIRenderer needs to use them as metadata in the font inside the generated .pvr file. Because it is impossible to generate a font
that contains all the UTF-8 characters (the texture would be way bigger than we could reasonably support) we need to select which
characters we will be generating in the font texture.
Supported options are:
  1) 7-bit ASCII character set: The common case - If no international support is required, this is the easiest solution. All 
     printable lower ASCII characters are generated (english characters and symbols in the range of 0-127)
  2) User-defined string: You input a specific string containing UTF-8 characters (using any language). For example, you could
     input the string "abcdefgABCDEFG.επμ", in which case you could create a font that would only be able to print the english 
     capital letters A-G, the english lowercase letters a-g, the period and the greek Epsilon, Pi and Mu. Any other characters
     used with UIRenderer would appear as spaces. For example the phrase "2nd Anchorage" would appear as " d A c  age" as the
     characters 2,n,h,o,r, are not generated and cannot be printed
  3) Text file: Exactly like the previous option, but the string comes from a text file instead of a string typed by the user.
     This is what we used to generate the UIRenderer fonts following the following steps.


THIS EXAMPLE
========
I. Generate the main title text (specific string with the Starjout font)
  1) Open PVRTextTool GUI
  2) Select File>Create Font Texture
  3) File: (click Browse, select the font from assets/Media/Starjout.ttf)
  4) FontOptions: [Size: 60px, Border: 0px, Grid fitting: no, Anti Aliasing: yes]
  5) Character Set: [Select "User-Defined String" from the dropdown]
     [Type "introducing uirenderer" in the text box"]
  6) Click OK
  7) Click the "Generate Mipmaps" button from the toolbox, linear, full mipmap chain, click Generate MIP Maps
  8) Save your generated file as "Starjout_60.pvr"
	 
II. Generate the subtitle text (Text file with the Arial font)
  1) Open PVRTextTool GUI
  2) Select File>Create Font Texture
  3) File: (click Browse, select the font from assets/Media/Arial Unicode.ttf)
  4) FontOptions: [Size: 36px, Border: 0px, Grid fitting: no, Anti Aliasing: yes]
  5) Character Set: [Select "Text File" from the dropdown, browse to .../ProcessedAssets/TitleText.txt]
  6) Click OK
  7) Click the "Generate Mipmaps" button from the toolbox, linear, full mipmap chain, click Generate MIP Maps
  8) Save your generated file as "title_36.pvr"

III. Generate the main scrolling text (Text file with the Arial font)
  1) Open PVRTextTool GUI
  2) Select File>Create Font Texture
  3) File: (click Browse, select the font from assets/Media/Arial Unicode.ttf)
  4) FontOptions: [Size: 36px, Border: 0px, Grid fitting: no, Anti Aliasing: yes]
  5) Character Set: [Select "Text File" from the dropdown, browse to .../ProcessedAssets/Text.txt]
  6) Click OK
  7) Click the "Generate Mipmaps" button from the toolbox, linear, full mipmap chain, click Generate MIP Maps
  8) Save your generated file as "arial_36.pvr"

You can now use these file directly with pvr::UIRenderer to generate fonts.
